*This project was developed using java programming lunguage and however most of the code was written using imperative programming.
Imperative programming is a software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on.[www.techtarget.com] (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/imperative-programming#:~:text=Imperative%20programming%20is%20a%20software,models%20are%20not%20called%20on.)
